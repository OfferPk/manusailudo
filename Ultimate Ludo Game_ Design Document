# Ultimate Ludo Game: Design Document

## 1. Game Overview

This document outlines the design for an advanced, web-based Ultimate Ludo Game. The game will be developed as a single HTML file using only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with no external libraries. It will support 2 to 6 players and incorporate a rich set of features including detailed player profiles, in-game currency, extensive settings, a support system, various notifications, and optional AI opponents. The goal is to create a "next-level" Ludo experience based on the provided references.

## 2. Core Game Logic

### 2.1. Player Setup
-   **Number of Players**: 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 players.
-   **Player Colors**: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Black.
-   **Tokens**: Each player has 4 tokens.
-   **Starting Position**: All tokens start at their respective home bases (position: -1).

### 2.2. Token Movement
-   **Leaving Home**: A player must roll a 6 on the dice to move a token from their home base onto the starting tile.
-   **Board Path**: Tokens move along a predefined, shared path on the game board in a clockwise direction.
-   **Home Path**: Each color has a unique home path leading to the central home area. Tokens enter their home path after completing a full circuit of the main board path.
-   **Movement Animation**: All token movements will be animated smoothly.

### 2.3. Capturing Tokens
-   If a player's token lands on a tile occupied by an opponent's token (and the tile is not a safe zone), the opponent's token is captured and sent back to its home base.

### 2.4. Safe Zones
-   **Designated Tiles**: Certain tiles on the board are designated as safe zones. Tokens on safe zones cannot be captured.
-   **Specific Safe Zones**:
    -   Each player's starting tile (the first tile after leaving home).
    -   Tiles marked with a star (as per common Ludo rules, typically 8 safe star tiles on the main path).
    -   The prompt also mentions "every home tile no 7" as a safe zone. This needs clarification, but likely refers to the 7th tile in each player's colored home path or a specific tile on the main path.
    -   "make a arrow on every number 4 one user go to four token move automatically into tile 5": This implies a special rule for tiles numbered '4', possibly advancing a token automatically to tile '5'. This needs to be integrated into the path logic.

### 2.5. Winning Condition
-   **Objective**: The first player to move all four of their tokens into their respective home areas (reaching the final tile of their home path) wins the game.
-   **Exact Dice Count**: Tokens must enter the home area and reach the final tile using an exact dice roll. If the roll is higher than the required number of steps, the token cannot move.
-   **Victory Notification**: A clear victory notification will be displayed to the winning player.

## 3. Dice Mechanics

-   **3D CSS Dice Cube**: A visually appealing 3D dice cube will be implemented using CSS3. It will display faces numbered 1 to 6.
-   **Realistic Animation**: The dice roll will feature a realistic bouncing and tumbling animation before settling on a random number.
-   **Dice Rotation**: The 3D dice will rotate to clearly show the rolled number on its top face.
-   **Interaction**: Players will click the dice (or a "Roll Dice" button) to initiate a roll.

## 4. Game Board Design

-   **Layout**: A 520x520 pixel canvas grid (or HTML elements styled to form a grid) will be used for the game board.
-   **Path Coordinates**: The board will have clearly defined coordinates or a logical system for token movement along the main path and individual home paths.
-   **Visual Cues**: Safe zones will be visually distinct (e.g., shaded differently, marked with a star).
-   **Home Entry**: Each player's home entry path will be clearly marked and lead towards the central home area.
-   **Multiple Tokens per Cell**: The game must support rendering multiple tokens on the same tile (e.g., stacked slightly offset, or side-by-side if space allows).

-   **Responsiveness**: The game interface should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring playability on both desktop and mobile devices (though primary focus might be desktop given the complexity).
-   **Maintainability**: Code should be well-structured, commented, and maintainable.

## 9. Game Assets (Conceptual)

-   **Board Texture/Design**: Visually appealing board background.
-   **Token Sprites/Designs**: Distinct designs for each color's tokens.
-   **Dice Faces**: Clear images or CSS designs for dice faces 1-6.
