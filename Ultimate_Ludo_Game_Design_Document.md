# Ultimate Ludo Game: Design Document

## 1. Game Overview

This document outlines the design for an advanced, web-based Ultimate Ludo Game. The game will be developed as a client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will feature rich graphics, smooth animations, and engaging gameplay mechanics.

## 2. Core Game Logic

### 2.1. Player Setup

-   **Number of Players**: 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 players.
-   **Player Colors**: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Black.
-   **Tokens**: Each player has 4 tokens.
-   **Starting Position**: All tokens start at their respective home bases (position: -1).

### 2.2. Token Movement

-   **Leaving Home**: A player must roll a 6 on the dice to move a token from their home base onto the starting tile.
-   **Board Path**: Tokens move along a predefined, shared path on the game board in a clockwise direction.
-   **Home Path**: Each color has a unique home path leading to the central home area. Tokens enter their home path after completing a full circuit of the board.
-   **Movement Animation**: All token movements will be animated smoothly.

### 2.3. Capturing Tokens

-   If a player's token lands on a tile occupied by an opponent's token (and the tile is not a safe zone), the opponent's token is captured and sent back to its home base.

### 2.4. Safe Zones

-   **Designated Tiles**: Certain tiles on the board are designated as safe zones. Tokens on safe zones cannot be captured.
-   **Specific Safe Zones**:
    -   Each player's starting tile (the first tile after leaving home).
    -   Tiles marked with a star (as per common Ludo rules, typically 8 safe star tiles on the main path).
    -   The prompt also mentions "every home tile no 7" as a safe zone. This needs clarification, but likely refers to the 7th tile within each player's colored home path, or perhaps 7 specific, globally safe tiles. For now, we will assume it means the colored home path tiles are safe.

### 2.5. Winning the Game

-   The first player to move all four of their tokens to the central home area wins the game.

## 3. Advanced Features (Beyond Standard Ludo)

### 3.1. Power-ups and Special Abilities

-   **Concept**: Players can collect or earn power-ups that grant temporary advantages.
-   **Examples**:
    -   **Shield**: Protects a token from capture for one turn.
    -   **Speed Boost**: Allows a token to move extra spaces.
    -   **Re-roll**: Allows the player to re-roll the dice.
    -   **Curse**: Send an opponent's token back a few spaces (if not on a safe zone).
-   **Acquisition**: Power-ups could be placed on specific tiles or awarded for certain achievements (e.g., capturing an opponent's token).

### 3.2. Customizable Game Boards and Themes

-   Players can choose from different board designs and visual themes.

### 3.3. Player Avatars and Profiles

-   Players can create and customize avatars.
-   Profiles will track stats, achievements, and win/loss records.

### 3.4. In-Game Chat

-   Allow players to communicate during the game.

### 3.5. Multiple Game Modes

-   **Classic Mode**: Standard Ludo rules.
-   **Quick Mode**: Faster gameplay, perhaps with fewer tokens or a shorter board path.
-   **Team Mode**: Players can team up (e.g., 2v2).

### 3.6. AI Opponents

-   Players can play against AI opponents with varying difficulty levels.

### 3.7. Online Multiplayer

-   Support for real-time online multiplayer games.
-   Matchmaking system.
-   Friend lists and private game invitations.

### 3.8. Daily Challenges and Rewards

-   Engage players with daily tasks and reward them with in-game currency or items.

### 3.9. Leaderboards

-   Global and friend-based leaderboards.

## 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

### 4.1. Main Menu

-   Options: Play (Single Player, Multiplayer), Settings, Profile, How to Play, Exit.

### 4.2. Game Screen

-   Clear display of the game board, player tokens, dice, and player information (names, colors, current turn).
-   Intuitive controls for rolling dice and selecting tokens.
-   Visual cues for valid moves, safe zones, and power-up locations.

### 4.3. Animations and Visual Effects

-   Smooth dice rolling animation.
-   Token movement animations.
-   Visual effects for capturing tokens, landing on safe zones, and using power-ups.

### 4.4. Sound Effects and Music

-   Engaging sound effects for game actions (dice roll, token move, capture, win, lose).
-   Background music (optional, with volume control).

## 5. Technical Design

### 5.1. Frontend (Client-Side)

-   **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
-   **CSS**: Styling and layout.
-   **JavaScript**: Game logic, DOM manipulation, animations, and interaction with any backend services.
    -   **Game State Management**: Keep track of player turns, token positions, scores, etc.
    -   **Rendering Engine**: Functions to draw and update the game board, tokens, and dice.
    -   **Input Handling**: Manage player inputs (dice rolls, token selections).

### 5.2. Backend (Server-Side - for Online Multiplayer)

-   **Technology Stack**: (To be decided - e.g., Node.js with Socket.IO, Python with Flask/Django Channels)
-   **Responsibilities**:
    -   User authentication and profile management.
    -   Matchmaking.
    -   Real-time game state synchronization between players.
    -   Leaderboard management.
    -   Handling in-game chat.

### 5.3. Assets

-   **Graphics**: Game board, tokens, dice, UI elements, avatars, power-up icons, themes.
-   **Sound**: Sound effects, background music.

## 6. Monetization (Optional - for consideration)

-   Cosmetic items (avatars, themes, dice skins).
-   Power-ups (though care must be taken not to make it pay-to-win).
-   Ad-free version.

## 7. Project Phases (High-Level)

1.  **Core Gameplay**: Implement basic Ludo rules, local multiplayer (hot-seat).
2.  **UI/UX Polish**: Improve graphics, animations, and overall user experience.
3.  **Advanced Features**: Add power-ups, AI opponents.
4.  **Online Multiplayer**: Develop backend, implement real-time online play.
5.  **Further Enhancements**: Customization, leaderboards, daily challenges.
