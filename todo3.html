Ludo Game - Website and APK Version Development Plan
 Phase 1: Website Version (React Progressive Web App)
 Outline plan for website and APK creation.
 Set up React project (create_react_app).
 Create basic directory structure (components, logic, assets, styles, contexts, hooks).
 Migrate existing JS logic files (config, game_logic, state_manager, etc.) to src/logic.
 Migrate CSS to src/styles.
 Migrate image assets to src/assets/images (and generate new ones like tokens, board).
 Create main React screen components (Loading, Home, PlayerSelection, GameTable, Settings).
 Refactor core logic modules (CONFIG, Utils, AssetsManager, StateManager, GameLogic, AIOpponent) to be ES modules.
 Implement React Context for global state management and actions (GameContext in Game.js).
 Integrate AssetsManager for loading images and (placeholder) sounds/music in React, accessible via context.
 Integrate StateManager with React Context to manage and distribute game state, with subscriptions for updates.
 Implement Game.js orchestrator to manage screens, initialize systems, and provide actions via context.
 Implement HomeScreen.js to use context for actions and display basic info.
 Implement PlayerSelectionScreen.js to configure game and use context to start it.
 Implement GameTableScreen.js with canvas for basic board/token rendering and game controls using context.
 Implement SettingsScreen.js with controls for volume and data reset, linked to context- [x] Integrate AI Opponent logic (ai_opponent.js) for AI turns, triggered from GameTableScreen.js.- [x] Refine GameTableScreen.js rendering (detailed board from board_renderer.js concepts, token animations from token_renderer.js concepts).
 Implement all UI interactions (e.g., highlighting playable tokens, visual feedback for game events) and ensure state consistency.
 Add remaining UI elements and features (e.g., modals for game over/help, notifications, improved dice animation).
 Thoroughly test game flow (all player counts, AI, rules like capture, safe zones, home entry, win conditions) in the browser.
 Ensure styling is polished and the application is responsive.
 Build the React application for production.
 Deploy the static build (e.g., using deploy_apply_deployment).
 Provide user with the deployed website URL.
 Phase 2: Android APK Version
 Research and select a suitable cross-platform framework (e.g., Capacitor).
 Install and configure the chosen framework and its dependencies (Android Studio, SDKs, etc.).
 Integrate the existing React web application into the chosen framework.
 Adapt any platform-specific features or UI if necessary.
 Configure app icons, splash screens, and build settings for Android.
 Build the debug and release APK.
 Test the APK on an Android device or emulator (User action required).with the generated APK file.
 Phase 3: Finalization
 Document the development process and any setup instructions.
 Report completion and deliver all artifacts to the user.
