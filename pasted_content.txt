Tokens must roll a 6 to leave home.

A token may capture another if it lands on it, unless the target is in a safe zone.

make a arrow on every number 4 one user go to four token move automatically into tile 5 


Tokens must enter home and reach the final tile via exact dice count.
once all four tokens enter home send a victory notification to the player that he win the game 

Each token movement is animated.

Game checks for victory condition: first player to bring all 4 tokens home wins.

Defined board path coordinates.

Safe zone cells shaded differently.

Home entry paths per player, leading to the center tile.

Status updates (Red rolled 6, etc.).

Sound or animation when a turn begins or token moves.

Token highlighting on selectable/moveable tokens after a roll.
