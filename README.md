Rules of Ludo

Ludo is a classic board game that originated in late Victorian times, inspired by the ancient Indian game of Pachisi. Over time, various adaptations of Pachisi have emerged across the world. These include Parchís in Spain, Parcheesi in the United States, and Uckers—a version of Ludo commonly played in the Royal Navy and other naval forces—using a standard Ludo board. While the game has evolved in design and rules across cultures, its core gameplay and spirit of friendly competition remain the same.
Ludo Game Rules (Simplified)
Game Overview:
Ludo is a strategy board game inspired by the ancient Indian game Pachisi. It’s played on a cross-shaped board where each arm is divided into colored paths. Each player picks a color—Red, Blue, Green, Yellow (with optional Pink and Black in extended versions)—and tries to move all four tokens from their base to the center "home" area.

🧱 Board Setup
The board has four colored bases (start zones) at each corner.

Each player starts with 4 tokens in their colored base.

The track loops clockwise around the board, leading to a final stretch called the "home column".

Only a player’s own tokens can enter their home column and final triangle.

🎲 How to Play
Players take turns clockwise. The player with the highest roll goes first.

A single die is used. Roll a 6 to bring a token onto the board.

Rolling a 6 gives an extra turn.

Tokens move in a clockwise direction along the path.

If you roll a number that can't be used, your turn is skipped.

You decide which token to move after every roll.

💥 Captures & Blocks
Landing on an opponent’s token sends it back to their base.

Landing on your own token creates a block—opponents can’t pass or land on it.

🏁 Winning the Game
Tokens must complete a full circuit and enter the home triangle with an exact roll.

The first player to get all 4 tokens home wins.

🔄 Variants
For faster gameplay with kids, allow tokens to start on a roll of 1 or 6.

For advanced strategy, explore Pachisi, Chaupur, or Uckers rules.
