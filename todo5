Ludo Game - Enhanced Website Version Development Plan
 Phase 1: Planning and Design
 Analyze enhancement and feature requirements (chat, leaderboards, WebSockets).
 Select appropriate web app templates (Flask for backend, React for frontend).
 Design enhanced game features and overall system architecture (see ludo_game_enhanced_architecture.md).
 Define backend API endpoints (REST for user/leaderboard, WebSockets for game/chat).
 Design database schema for users, game state, leaderboards, and chat messages.
 Outline frontend component structure for new features (details in ludo_game_enhanced_architecture.md).
 Plan WebSocket communication flow for real-time updates.
 Phase 2: Backend Development (Flask)
 Set up Flask project structure.
 Implement user authentication and management.
 Implement WebSocket server for real-time game logic and chat (game creation, join, start, roll, move, disconnect, chat handlers implemented; core Ludo rules and robust state management in place).
 Develop API endpoints for leaderboard data.
 Implement database models and logic for storing user, game, leaderboard, and chat data.
 Set up database (MySQL configured).
 Phase 3: Frontend Development (React)
 Set up new React project for the enhanced game website (e.g., using create-react-app or Vite) - project created.
 Implement basic project structure (components, services, contexts, assets, styles, pages).
 Implement UI for user authentication (Login, Registration forms created, integration with backend auth APIs complete).
 Set up WebSocket client service/context to connect to the Flask backend (SocketContext.js created and integrated).
 Develop UI components for the game lobby (GameLobbyPage.js created, WebSocket integration complete).
 Develop UI components for the game room (GameRoomPage.js created, board placeholder, WebSocket integration for game events and chat complete).
 Develop UI components for chat functionality (chat form in GameRoomPage.js, WebSocket integration complete).
 Develop UI components for displaying leaderboards (LeaderboardPage.js created, API integration complete).
 Integrate game logic with WebSocket events (sending player actions, receiving game state updates in relevant page components).
 Implement turn management and visual feedback for game events on the frontend (basic elements in GameRoomPage.js, core logic complete).
 Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes (global styles added, component-specific refinement ongoing).
 Phase 4: Integration and Testing
 Integrate frontend components with backend APIs and WebSockets (all core integrations complete, backend now running with SQLite).
 Thoroughly test all new features: chat, leaderboards, real-time multiplayer gameplay (user registration, login, game creation, joining games, playing turns, dice rolling, token movement, captures, winning conditions, chat functionality, leaderboard updates).
 Test responsive design across different screen sizes and devices (simulated).
 Perform end-to-end testing of user flows.
 Test user authentication and data persistence.
 Perform end-to-end testing of the complete game website.
 Phase 5: Deployment and Delivery
 Build the React frontend for production.
 Configure Flask backend for production (using SQLite for now, serving static files).
 Deploy the Flask backend and the React frontend.
 Provide user with the deployed game website URL.
 Document the development process, architecture, and setup instructions.
 Report completion and deliver all artifacts to the user.
