Enhanced Ludo Game - System Architecture Design
1. Overview
This document outlines the system architecture for the enhanced Ludo game website. The game will feature real-time multiplayer gameplay, user accounts, leaderboards, and in-game chat functionality. The architecture will consist of a React frontend and a Flask backend, utilizing WebSockets for real-time communication.

2. Technology Stack
Frontend: React (potentially enhancing the existing PWA structure or a new build)
State Management: React Context API or Redux (to be decided based on complexity)
WebSocket Client: Standard browser WebSocket API or a library like socket.io-client (if Flask-SocketIO is used on the backend).
Styling: Tailwind CSS (from existing project) or other modern CSS framework.
Backend: Flask (Python)
WebSocket Server: Flask-Sockets, Flask-SocketIO, or a similar Flask extension for WebSockets.
Database: MySQL (as per Flask template guidance) or SQLite for simpler local development.
ORM: SQLAlchemy.
API: RESTful APIs for user management and leaderboards; WebSocket endpoints for game and chat.
Deployment: To be determined (e.g., separate deployment for frontend static files and backend application).

3. Backend Architecture (Flask)
3.1. API Endpoints
3.1.1. RESTful APIs
User Authentication
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
Request Body: { "username": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string" }
Response: { "message": "User registered successfully" } or error.
POST /api/auth/login: Log in an existing user.
Request Body: { "username_or_email": "string", "password": "string" }
Response: { "access_token": "jwt_token", "user": { "id": "int", "username": "string" } } or error.
POST /api/auth/logout: Log out the current user (requires token).
Response: { "message": "Logged out successfully" }.
GET /api/auth/me: Get current authenticated user details (requires token).
Response: { "user": { "id": "int", "username": "string", "email": "string" } }.
Leaderboards
GET /api/leaderboard?game_mode=<mode>&limit=<limit>: Get top scores for a specific game mode.
Response: [ { "username": "string", "score": "int", "rank": "int" } ].
GET /api/leaderboard/user/<user_id>?game_mode=<mode>: Get a specific user's rank and score.
Response: { "username": "string", "score": "int", "rank": "int" }.
3.1.2. WebSocket Endpoints
Connection Namespace: / (or specific namespaces like /game and /chat if using Flask-SocketIO)
Game Events (e.g., on /game namespace or with specific event names)
Client emits join_game: { "game_id": "string", "user_id": "int" } (or handled via lobby HTTP API first)
Server emits game_update: { "game_state": "object", "current_player": "int", "dice_roll": "int", "last_move": "object" } (broadcast to players in the game room)
Client emits roll_dice: { "game_id": "string" }
Client emits move_token: { "game_id": "string", "token_id": "int", "new_position": "int" }
Server emits player_joined: { "user_id": "int", "username": "string" } (to other players in the room).
Server emits player_left: { "user_id": "int", "username": "string" } (to other players in the room).
Server emits game_over: { "winner_id": "int", "scores": "object" }
Chat Events (e.g., on /chat namespace or with specific event names)
Client emits send_message: { "game_id": "string" (optional), "text": "string" }
Server emits new_message: { "user_id": "int", "username": "string", "text": "string", "timestamp": "datetime" } (broadcast to players in the game room or global chat).

3.2. Database Schema
User Table (users)
id (Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment)
username (String, Unique, Not Null)
email (String, Unique, Not Null)
password_hash (String, Not Null)
created_at (DateTime, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
Game Table (games)
id (String/UUID, Primary Key) - Game room ID
game_type (String, e.g., "classic_ludo", "quick_ludo")
status (String, e.g., "waiting", "in_progress", "finished", "abandoned")
current_turn_player_id (Integer, Foreign Key to users.id, Nullable)
game_state_json (Text/JSON, stores the current board, token positions, etc.)
created_at (DateTime, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
updated_at (DateTime, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, On Update: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
PlayerGame Table (player_games) - Junction table for users and games (many-to-many)
user_id (Integer, Foreign Key to users.id)
game_id (String/UUID, Foreign Key to games.id)
score (Integer, Nullable)
rank (Integer, Nullable)
Primary Key (user_id, game_id)

4. Frontend Architecture (React)
4.1. Component Structure (High-Level)
App.js (Routing, Global State)
Auth Components (Login, Register, Profile)
Lobby Components (Game Creation, Joining, Game List)
Game Components
  Board (renders board, tokens)
  Dice (renders dice, handles roll animation)
  PlayerInfo (displays player names, scores, turn indicator)
  Chat (in-game chat interface)
Shared Components (Buttons, Modals, etc.)

4.2. State Management
User authentication state (token, user details)
Game lobby state (available games, players in lobby)
In-game state (board, tokens, current player, dice value, game status, chat messages)
Consider using React Context for simpler state or Redux for more complex state management, especially with real-time updates.

4.3. WebSocket Integration
Establish WebSocket connection upon entering lobby or game.
Listen for server-emitted events (game updates, chat messages, player join/leave).
Emit client events (join game, roll dice, move token, send message).
Handle connection errors and reconnections.

5. Deployment Strategy (Placeholder)
Frontend: Static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) or served by Flask if PWA.
Backend: Dockerized Flask application deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run).
Database: Managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) or self-hosted on a server.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

6. Scalability and Performance Considerations
Optimize database queries.
Use efficient data structures for game state.
Consider load balancing for backend if high traffic is expected.
WebSocket connection management (limit connections per user, handle disconnections gracefully).
Frontend performance: code splitting, lazy loading, memoization.

7. Security Considerations
Input validation on both frontend and backend.
Secure JWT handling (HTTPS only, short expiry, refresh tokens).
Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
Rate limiting for API endpoints.
Secure WebSocket connections (WSS).

8. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
AI Opponents
Different game modes (e.g., team play, quick match)
Customizable game rules
Player avatars and profiles
Achievements and rewards
Social features (friend lists, private messaging)
Spectator mode
