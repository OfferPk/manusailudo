# Ultcomplete Ludo Game: Design Document

## 1. Game Overview

This document outlines the design for an advanced, web-based Ultimate Ludo Game. The game will be developed as a client-side application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will feature rich graphics, smooth animations, and engaging gameplay mechanics.

## 2. Core Game Logic

### 2.1. Player Setup

- **Number of Players**: 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 players.
- **Player Colors**: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Black.
- **Tokens**: Each player has 4 tokens.
- **Starting Position**: All tokens start at their respective home bases (position: -1).

### 2.2. Token Movement

- **Leaving Home**: A player must roll a 6 on the dice to move a token from their home base onto the starting tile.
- **Board Path**: Tokens move along a predefined, shared path on the game board in a clockwise direction.
- **Home Path**: Each color has a unique home path leading to the central home area. Tokens enter their home path after completing a full circuit of the board.
- **Movement Animation**: All token movements will be animated smoothly.

### 2.3. Capturing Tokens

If a player's token lands on a tile occupied by an opponent's token (and the tile is not a safe zone), the opponent's token is captured and sent back to its home base.

### 2.4. Safe Zones

- **Designated Tiles**: Certain tiles on the board are designated as safe zones. Tokens on safe zones cannot be captured.
- **Specific Safe Zones**:
    - Each player's starting tile (the first tile after leaving home).
    - Tiles marked with a star (as per common Ludo rules, typically 8 safe star tiles on the main path).
    - The prompt also mentions "every home tile no 7" as a safe zone. This needs clarification, but likely refers to the 7th tile within each player's colored home path, or perhaps 7 specific, globally safe tiles. For now, we will assume it means the colored home path tiles are safe.

### 2.5. Winning the Game

The first player to move all four of their tokens to the central home area wins the game.

## 3. Advanced Features (Beyond Standard Ludo)

### 3.1. Power-ups and Special Abilities

- **Concept**: Players can collect or earn power-ups that grant temporary advantages.
- **Examples**:
    - **Shield**: Protects a token from capture for one turn.
    - **Speed Boost**: Allows a token to move extra spaces.
    - **Re-roll**: Allows the player to re-roll the dice.
    - **Curse**: Send an opponent's token back a few spaces (if not on a safe zone).
    - **Acquisition**: Power-ups could be placed on specific tiles or awarded for certain achievements (e.g., capturing an opponent's token).

### 3.2. Customizable Game Boards and Themes

Players can choose from different board designs and visual themes.

### 3.3. Player Avatars and Profiles

Players can create and customize avatars.
Profiles will track stats, achievements, and win/loss records.

### 3.4. AI Opponents

- **Difficulty Levels**: Multiple AI difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Behavior**: AI will use strategies for token movement, capturing, and using power-ups.

### 3.5. Multiplayer Mode

- **Online Play**: Players can compete against others online.
- **Private Rooms**: Option to create private game rooms for friends.
- **Matchmaking**: System to match players of similar skill levels.
- **Chat**: In-game chat functionality.

### 3.6. Game Variations

- **Quick Mode**: Faster gameplay with modified rules (e.g., fewer tokens, different dice roll requirements).
- **Team Play**: Players can team up (e.g., 2v2, 3v3).

## 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

### 4.1. Visual Design

- **Modern and Appealing**: Clean, vibrant, and engaging visuals.
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for dice rolls, token movements, captures, and power-up effects.
- **Responsive Design**: The game should be playable on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### 4.2. Game Controls

- **Intuitive**: Easy-to-understand controls for rolling dice, selecting tokens, and using power-ups.
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual cues for player turns, available moves, and game events.

### 4.3. Menus and Navigation

- **Main Menu**: Options for starting a new game (single-player, multiplayer), settings, help, and player profile.
- **In-Game Menu**: Options to pause, resume, restart, or quit the game; access settings and chat.

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1. Frontend

- **Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Framework/Library (Optional)**: Consider using a lightweight framework like Vue.js or React for better structure and component management, or stick to vanilla JavaScript if simplicity is preferred and the single HTML file constraint is strict.
- **Graphics**: SVG for scalable board and token graphics; CSS animations or a JavaScript animation library (e.g., GreenSock/GSAP) for complex animations.

### 5.2. Backend (for Online Multiplayer and Persistent Data)

- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js, Python with Flask/Django, or other suitable backend technology.
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL for storing user profiles, game state, and leaderboards.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for multiplayer interactions.

### 5.3. APK Generation (if native Android app is a strict requirement)

- **Method 1 (WebView Wrapper)**: Package the web application into an APK using tools like Apache Cordova, Capacitor, or by creating a native Android app with a WebView component.
- **Method 2 (Progressive Web App - PWA)**: Develop the game as a PWA, which can be "installed" on Android devices and offer an app-like experience. This aligns well with the web-first approach.
- **Method 3 (Native Rewrite - High Effort)**: Rewrite the game natively in Java/Kotlin for Android. This is the most effort-intensive but provides the best native performance and integration.

## 6. Monetization (Optional)

- **Cosmetic Items**: Selling themes, avatars, or token skins.
- **Ad-Supported**: Displaying non-intrusive ads (e.g., rewarded ads for extra rolls or power-ups).

## 7. Development Plan (High-Level)

1.  **Core Game Logic**: Implement basic Ludo rules, player setup, token movement, capture, and win conditions.
2.  **UI/UX Basics**: Create the game board, tokens, dice, and basic UI elements.
3.  **AI Opponent (Basic)**: Develop a simple AI for single-player mode.
4.  **Advanced Features**: Implement power-ups, custom themes, player profiles.
5.  **Multiplayer Backend**: Set up server, database, and WebSocket communication.
6.  **Multiplayer Frontend**: Integrate online play, private rooms, chat.
7.  **Polishing**: Refine graphics, animations, sound effects, and overall UX.
8.  **Testing**: Thorough testing across different browsers and devices.
9.  **Deployment**: Deploy web version and package APK if required.

## 8. Missing Pieces (from current repo compared to this design)

-   Full backend implementation for multiplayer, user accounts, leaderboards.
-   WebSocket integration on both client and server.
-   Most advanced features: power-ups, customizable themes, detailed player profiles, game variations.
-   Sophisticated AI.
-   Detailed UI for menus, settings, chat.
-   Sound effects and music.
-   Build process for combining JS/CSS if single HTML constraint is strict.
-   Clear strategy and implementation for APK generation (beyond the existing `app-debug.apk` which needs to be verified).
-   The `utils.js` file mentioned in `Missing or Incomplete Components` document.
-   Actual image and sound asset files.

This design document aims for a comprehensive Ludo game. The existing repository provides a starting point, primarily on the frontend, but significant development is needed to achieve this vision.
